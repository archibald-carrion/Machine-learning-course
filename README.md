Welcome to my machine learning repository! 
Here you'll find my personal notes and explanations of each used algorithm, along with the code I wrote to implement them, a bunch of resources, and some fun projects I worked on.
This repository is a work in progress, and I plan to add more content over time.

Note: It's important to note that this repository only contains very small projects, to see more complex projects, please check out my other repositories or the section below for related projects.

## Currently implemented algorithms:
- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/archibald-carrion/Machine-learning-course/tree/main/diabetes_linear_regression)
- [Titanic Predictive Analysis](https://github.com/archibald-carrion/Machine-learning-course/tree/main/titanic_predictive_analysis) using a multitude of basic algorithms (KNN, Random Forests, etc.)
